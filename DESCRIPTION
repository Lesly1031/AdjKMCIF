Version: 1.0.0
Author: Biwei Cao, Jongphil Kim
Maintainer: Biwei Cao <biwei.cao@moffitt.org>
Description: Our R package allows practitioners to estimate the covariate-adjusted KM functions and CIFs based upon the Cox and the Fine-Gray regression model, respectively. The Gail and Byar method and the Storer method are offered in the package when the stratified model is used. Additionally, the bootstrap method is available for estimating pointwise confidence intervals.
